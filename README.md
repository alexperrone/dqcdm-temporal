This repository has collected different work from the Temporal Group. Most of the work is being presented in a Shiny app. For a selected condition (concept_id) and data source, the Shiny app presents results of different analyses in 4 tabs:

The 1st tab on the app overviews the data and calculates a "typical" annual pattern. It then highlights data points that statistically deviate from the "typical" pattern.
